# Multi-Aperture-Quantum-Imaging
Quantum super-resolution imaging using optical systems with multiple apertures.



### Future Code Updates:
- Make X,Y coordinate grid types just vectors (main change will be in EM algorithm)
- Remove unused functions from utils folder
- Create a structure for Data collection and merging accross multiple datasets
- Make aperture and image plane coordinate definitions independent (no need for reference unit)
